Problems to tackle:

1. Display the default state at beginning, arranged according to their date of Publication.
    - Dilemma: A lot of data duplication takes place, if I use the approach I used in displaying the 'All' infotypes.

2. Highlight the 'Infotypes' on selection. Currently, it is not visually apparent which Infotypes ins the Content component showing.
    - Possible Alternative: The Info Template for each infotype template looks different.

3. Add a Search Bar.
